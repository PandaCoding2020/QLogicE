YAGO3-10: data is this dataset is including four zip files triples(YAGO3-10).zip, train(YAGO3-10).zip,valid(YAGO3-10).zip and test(YAGO3-10).zip.
## note: 
The datasets FB15k237,WN18RR and YAGO3-10 all contain four text related with training. The file triples.txt is including all triples of train.txt, valid.txt and test.txt due to the fact that train.txt doesn't contains all enities and relations in the dataset. This may cuase the programme running error.
